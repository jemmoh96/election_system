# election_system

This codebase provides a foundational system for an electronic voting system, with emphasis on security, user authentication, error handling, and compliance considerations. Further enhancements and real-world testing would be necessary before deployment in a production environment.

Setup and Running the Application

<b>1. Install Required Libraries:</b>

		pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_wtf flask_migrate

<b>2. Initialize the Database:</b>

		flask db init
		flask db migrate
		flask db upgrade

<b>3. Run the Flask Application:</b>

		python app.py
	
<b>Security and Compliance Considerations</b>

<b>1. Data Encryption:</b>

Ensure all sensitive information is encrypted.

Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.

Store hashed security answers rather than plain text.

<b>2. User Authentication:</b>

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if necessary.

Regularly audit access logs and security protocols.

<b>3. Error Handling:</b>

Use robust error handling and logging mechanisms.

Ensure that the system gracefully handles invalid inputs.

<b>4. Compliance with Kenyan Election Laws:</b>

Ensure voter privacy and data protection.

Maintain transparency and integrity of the election process.

Regularly review legal requirements and update the system accordingly.
